CODE PACKAGING

C1. Find where weights are downloaded upon first run
C2. Write minimal and complete requirements.txt
C3. Cleanup paths/etc so that main.py can be run from an arbitrary dir
C4. Clarify all changes wrt original codebase (maybe rebase them?)
C5. Add cmdline to png comment, for a self-explanatory output
C6. Package this code for ease of use outside of IPOL (?)
C7. Round-trip: write a "check_sd_png" that verifies the png comment by
re-running the command line and checking that the exact same image is obtained


DEMO

D1. Decide which parameters to expose
D2. Hide/disallow incompatible parameters
D3. Clarify parameter meanings in the interface
D4. For the number of iterations, expose an approximation of its effect in
terms of total running time.
D5. Do not display broken input image when it does not exist
D6. Simplify run line, remove debug stuff


ARTICLE

A1. Elaborate a script that runs all the experiments to be shown in the paper
A2. Run this script on limule to obtain all the png files
A3. Experimental section: decide on a series of meaningful experiments to show
A4. Introduction: write blah blah blah, find comprehensive references
A5. Dependencies: explain all "ingredients" and why are they needed
